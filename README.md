# ScienceFair
This repo contains MATLAB code written for my 2020 INSPO and YSC science fair project titled "Detecting Tinnitus: GPIAS relationships with hearing in mice."
Each of the three files extracts one feature from the ASR waveforms I recorded, cleans noise with a Savitsky Golay filter, and processes it.
All code is self-written and third party functions used are not included.
